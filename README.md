# Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting diseases based on medical data using different machine learning algorithms. The dataset includes features related to medical conditions, and the goal is to predict the corresponding disease label.

## Overview

The following machine learning models are used to predict diseases:

- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

Each model is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, cross-validation scores, and confusion matrix analysis. The model performance is visually represented using bar plots and confusion matrices.

## Features

- **SVM**: A Support Vector Machine classifier with probability estimation.
- **Naive Bayes**: A Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier.
- **Random Forest**: A Random Forest classifier with balanced class weights and 200 trees.

## Data

The ([dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning?select=Testing.csv)) consists of training and testing data files in CSV format (`Training.csv` and `Testing.csv`). The features represent medical data, and the target variable is the disease label.
